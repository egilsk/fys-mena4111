Dear Egil Sperstad KÃ¸ller, welcome to Abel

Your username is:               egilsk
You may run jobs in project(s): 

Abel is a joint venture where the main partners are: The Norwegian Research
Council (Uninett Sigma2, via the Notur project) and the University of Oslo
(Depts. of Astrophysics, Chemistry, Biology, CMBN, CEES and others).

Abel is a cluster with 700+ nodes. Most nodes have 16 cores and 64 GiB memory
(of which 61.5 GiB is available for jobs), in total 11,000+ cores and 52 TiB
of memory. The CPUs are 8-core 2.6 GHz Intel E5-2670.  All nodes are connected
to a low latency 56 Gbit/s Infiniband network and gigabit Ethernet.  All nodes
have access to 600 TiB of BeeGFS parallel file system storage.  Abel users may
apply for access to the 3 PiB NorStore storage facility.  For particularly
large memory jobs, a few hugemem nodes with 1 TiB memory are accessible
through the queue system.  Currently users can run regular parallel jobs up to
512 cores.  Larger parallel jobs might be possible, but please contact us up
front.

Information about how to use Abel, the job scheduling system, modules,
compilers and useful commands can be found at our web-site:

   http://uio.no/hpc/abel/

Follow the 'User Guide' link.  The Notur web site has information
about all the national resources:

  http://www.sigma2.no/

By default, you can use up to 500 GiB of disk space in your home directory.
The files in the home directory are backed up regularly.  Please put any files
that do not _need_ backup (downloaded files, temporary files, etc.) in a
directory called 'nobackup' to lower the load on the backup system.  More info
about backup can be found in http://uio.no/hpc/abel/help/user-guide/data.html

You log on to 'abel.uio.no' with username 'egilsk' and your UiO password.
If you have received a UiO username but do not read UiO mail, you _must_
set up mail forwarding: https://brukerinfo.uio.no/email/forward.php

Please use 'qlogin' as described in
http://uio.no/hpc/abel/help/user-guide/interactive-logins.html if you need to
run test runs of more than 15 minutes in order to limit the load on the login
nodes.

Some useful commands as a user on the Abel system are:

  sbatch <job-script-file>   Submit a job script to the queue system
  squeue                     List of all jobs
  pending                    List of all pending jobs
  qsumm                      Summary information about queue usage
  cost -u                    User CPU Usage information
  cost -p                    Project CPU Usage information
  projects                   Lists the projects you are member of
  module avail               Lists available software Modules
  module list                Lists your currently used software Modules
  dusage                     List home directory disk usage
  dusage -p <project>        List project disk usage

Welcome as an Abel user!
