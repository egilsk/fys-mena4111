INCAR for ionic relaxation,

! Electronic relaxation
ALGO   = Fast      ! Algorithm for electronic relaxation
NELMIN = 4         ! Minimum # of electronic steps
EDIFF  = 1E-5      ! Accuracy for electronic groundstate
ENCUT  = 500       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave expansion
PREC   = Accurate  ! Normal/Accurate
LREAL  = Auto      ! Projection in reciprocal space?
ISMEAR = 0         ! Smearing of partial occupancies. Metals: 1; else < 1.
SIGMA  = 0.2       ! Smearing width
ISPIN  = 1         ! Spin polarization?

! Ionic relaxation
EDIFFG = -0.01     ! Tolerance for ions
NSW    = 80        ! Max # of ionic steps
MAXMIX = 80        ! Keep dielectric function between ionic movements
IBRION = 1         ! Algorithm for ions. 0: MD 1: QN/DIIS 2: CG
ISIF   = 3         ! Relaxation. 2: ions 3: ions+cell
ADDGRID= .TRUE.    ! More accurate forces with PAW

! Output options
NWRITE = 1         ! Write electronic convergence at first step only

! Memory handling
NPAR    = 2        ! Should be ~sqrt(cpus)
