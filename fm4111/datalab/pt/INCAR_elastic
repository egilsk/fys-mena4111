INCAR for elastic calculations

! Electronic relaxation
ALGO   = Fast      ! Algorithm for electronic relaxation
NELMIN = 4         ! Minimum # of electronic steps
EDIFF  = 1E-5      ! Accuracy for electronic groundstate
ENCUT  = 500       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave expansion
PREC   = Accurate  ! Normal/Accurate
LREAL  = Auto      ! Projection in reciprocal space?
ISMEAR = 0         ! Smearing of partial occupancies. Metals: 1; else < 1.
SIGMA  = 0.2       ! Smearing width
ISPIN  = 1         ! Spin polarization?

! Ionic relaxation
ISIF   = 3         ! Volume relaxation
IBRION = 6         ! Calculate the Hessian matrix
NFREE  = 2         ! Number of displacements
POTIM  = 0.02      ! Size of displacement

! Output options
NWRITE = 1         ! Write electronic convergence at first step only

! Memory handling
