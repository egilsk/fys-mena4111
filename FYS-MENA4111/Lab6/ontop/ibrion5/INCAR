INCAR for calculation of zero point vibrations

! Electronic relaxation
ALGO   = Fast      ! Algorithm for electronic relaxation
NELMIN = 4         ! Minimum # of electronic steps
EDIFF  = 1E-6      ! Accuracy for electronic groundstate
ENCUT  = 500       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave expansion
PREC   = Accurate  ! Normal/Accurate
LREAL  = Auto      ! Projection in reciprocal space?
ISMEAR = -5         ! Smearing of partial occupancies. k-points >2: -5; else 0
SIGMA  = 0.2       ! Smearing width
ISPIN  = 1         ! Spin polarization?

! Ionic relaxation
IBRION = 5         ! Calculate Hessian matrix
NFREE  = 2         ! Number of displacements
POTIM  = 0.1     ! Step size
ISIF   = 2         ! Relaxation. 2: ions 3: ions+cell

! Output options
LWAVE  = .FALSE.   ! Write WAVECAR?
LCHARG = .FALSE.   ! Write CHGCAR?
!NEDOS  = 2101       ! Number of grid points for DOS
!EMIN   = -9        ! Minimum energy for evaluation of DOS
!EMAX   =  12       ! Maximum energy for evaluation of DOS

! Memory handling
NPAR    = 4        ! Should be = (# cpus) when IBRION = 5!
