INCAR for ionic relaxation

! Electronic relaxation
IALGO   = 48      ! Algorithm for electronic relaxation
NELMIN = 4         ! Minimum # of electronic steps
EDIFF  = 1E-5      ! Accuracy for electronic groundstate
ENCUT  = 250       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave expansion
PREC   = Normal    ! Low/Normal/Accurate
LREAL  = Auto      ! Projection in reciprocal space?
ISMEAR = 0         ! Smearing of partial occupancies.
SIGMA  = 0.2       ! Smearing width
ISPIN  = 1         ! Spin polarization?
ISYM = 0

! Ionic relaxation
NSW    = 50        ! Final high-accuracy calculation without relaxation
EDIFFG = -0.05     ! Tolerance for ions
IBRION = 1         ! Algorithm for ions. 0: MD 1: QN/DIIS 2: CG
ISIF   = 2         ! Relaxation. 2: ions 3: ions+cell
MAXMIX = 80        ! Keep dielectric function between ionic movements

! Output options
LWAVE  = .FALSE.   ! Write WAVECAR?

! Memory handling
NPAR    = 2
